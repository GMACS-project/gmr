# gmr 1.2.0.9001
*************************************************************************

Here are some of the items for the next release:

- [ ] Check all plotting functions
- [ ] Improve code
- [ ] Create vignettes to build and run gmacs, make comparison
- [ ] Create SAFE document templates
- [ ] Add data and implement examples in the package


# gmr 1.2.0
*************************************************************************

(GitHub issue/PR numbers in parentheses)

This is a minor version update that includes modification of some functions to 
make `gmr` compatible with MacOs/Linux and avoid the use of paste() and paste0()
for defining file paths to file.path. Some additions have also been made in 
function documentation (#13).

*Versioning has been updated correctly. (change from 0.1.1 to 1.2.0).*

## New functions

  * `createGmacsExe()`: Function to get the GMACS executable from TPL file.
  * `clean_files()`: Function to clean files in a specific folder.
  * `clean_root()`: Function to clean gmacs compilation-process files in the "root folder".
  * `clean_bat()`: Function to clean gmacs output files in a folder.
  * `isWindowsOS`: Identify if the OS type is windows
  
## Updated functions

  * `Do_GMACS()`
  * `.buildGMACS()`
  * `write_TPL()`: is now exported (#11).

# gmr 0.1.1
*************************************************************************

(GitHub issue/PR numbers in parentheses)

This new version allows to directly run GMACS within R instead of going through
the various windows prompt (#1).

## New functions

  * `GMACS()`, which allows you to compile, run and make comparison of different
  versions of GMACS for one or several stocks. This is the main function to work 
  with the GMACS model with the `gmr` package.
  * `Do_GMACS()`, which is called by the `GMACS()` function. It allows to build the 
  GMACS executable, run the model and make comparison between multiple versions 
  of GMACS if the user ask for.
  * `Do_Comp()`, which establishes comparison tables of management quantities 
  between different versions of GMACS.
  * `.GetGmacsExe()`, which allows to update and "release" a new version of GMACS.
  * `.CallTerm()`, which allows to call a R terminal to execute a specific command.
  * `read.OUT()`, which is designed to read the gmacsall.OUT (output of GMACS) to 
  find estimates of specific management/biological quantities.
  
Other functions (called within the ones described above) have also been added to
the `gmr` package but are internal functions.
  

# gmr 0.1.0
*************************************************************************

This is the status of the gmr package in March 2020. It will serve as the basis 
for the futrure developments of the `gmr` package.
